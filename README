Rock Paper Scissors

This super awesome tool let's you run a consume the Twitter streaming API and play Rock Paper Scissors with people that mention it and include the word Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Installation:
Copy config.yml.template to config.yml and fill in the twitter screen name and credentials from your Twitter account that will act as the bot.

Run the daemon with:
ruby rock_paper_scissors.rb start

Tweet something like:
@botname Rock, I choose you!

The bot will reply with its answer.

Customizing your own bot:
Creating your own bot is super simple. CharlieMurphy is the default bot and should be used as a template for more complex bots.

Your bot class needs to inherit from RockPaperScissorBot, and implement the following two methods:
choice
method

You can test your bot to make sure it implements the interface correctly by running:
ruby test.rb <BotClass>

Run the following to see what the output should look like.
ruby test.rb CharlieMurphy

To modify which bots are used by the twitter daemon, edit the array at the top of rock_paper_scissors.rb
